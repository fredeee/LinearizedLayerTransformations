# Layerwise Jacobian Analysis

To install the package locally, navigate to the `layerwise_jacobian_analysis` directory and run
```commandline
pip install -e .
```
Initialise the remainder of the project skeleton:
```commandline
mkdir data docs results tests 
```
The intended contents of each of these directories
is explained in the [Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/setup.html#create-a-project-skeleton).

Now you should be able to run the scripts, such as:
```commandline
python scripts/train_logical_network.py
```
